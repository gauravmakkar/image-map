# `image-map` â€” An Image Map Example Based on AngularJS


## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the `image-map` repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the `image-map` repository.

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and Angular framework code. The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [Node package manager][npm].
* We get the Angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`. After that, you should find out that you have
two new folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the Angular framework files

*Note that the `bower_components` folder would normally be installed in the root folder but
`image-map` changes this location through the `.bowerrc` file. Putting it in the `app` folder
makes it easier to serve the files by a web server.*

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:8005/`]

### TODO

1. Remove inline styling.
2. Beautification.
